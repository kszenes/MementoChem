# Description

This repo hosts the a website which allows to generate input files for common quantum chemistry programs.
It has currently limited capabilities (only supports ORCA so far) but will be extended further in the future, see below.

## TODO

- [ ] Add stability analysis for unrestricted calculations
- [ ] Finish MP2
- [ ] Add roots to CASSCF
- [ ] Add CASCI (no orbital rotations)
- [ ] Add MRPT2
- [ ] Add resolution of identity / cholesky
- [ ] Add PES scan
- [ ] Add other geometry specification methods besides xyz
- [ ] Add other chemistry programs
