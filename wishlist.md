## Roadmap

The functionality of `MementoChem` is being actively developed, see below.

### TODO

- [ ] Add explicit correlation
- [ ] Add counterpoise correction
- [ ] Add PES scan
- [ ] Add other geometry specification methods besides xyz
- [ ] Frequency calculation for PySCF and OpenMolcas
- [ ] Add input validation (e.g., multiplicity is consistent)
- [ ] Add fcisolver to CAS calculations
- [ ] Psi4: Print spin contamination for unrestricted methods (not sure if this is possible)

### DONE

- [x] Add frozen core
- [x] Add dark mode
- [x] Add CI methods
- [x] Add outorb for CASSCF
- [x] Psi4
- [x] Add syntax highlighting
- [x] Add CASCI (no orbital rotations)
- [x] Add UHF guess mix
- [x] Add units for xyz
- [x] Support loading from structure from a file
- [x] Add support for integral direct methods
- [x] Add resolution of identity / cholesky
- [x] Add roots to CASSCF
- [x] Finish MP2 (add natural orbital option)
- [x] Add stability analysis for unrestricted calculations
- [x] Add MRPT2
- [x] Add support for second-order solvers
- [x] Add advanced settings for SCF (e.g., initial guess, energy convergence criteria)
